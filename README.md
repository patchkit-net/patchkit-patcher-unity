# Deprecation Notice
It is no longer recommended to use the Unity launcher. Please switch to the PatchKit Launcher SDK instead for better support and improved functionality. You can find the getting started guide here: [https://patchkit.net/resources/sdk-getting-started/](https://patchkit.net/resources/sdk-getting-started/) and the full documentation here: [https://docs.patchkit.net/launcher_sdk/](https://docs.patchkit.net/launcher_sdk/).

# PatchKit Unity Patcher

* [Documentation](http://docs.patchkit.net/unity_custom_patcher.html)

In this repository you can find PatchKit Patcher Unity project.

## Getting the stable version

It's pretty important to use a stable and tester patcher version. You will find stable releases in [here](https://github.com/patchkit-net/patchkit-patcher-unity/releases). Be careful, **pre-releases** are not suitable for production usage. **Master** branch is also not suitable for production usage. Always look for tags if you want to do an upgrade.

## Executing without the Launcher
Sometimes, usually for the purpose of testing, we might want to start the Patcher without using the Launcher. It's possible through the use of 2 command line options `--secret` and `--installdir`, and most of the time also `--readable` which forces the Patcher to interpret given secret without decoding it.

Example:
```
> Patcher.exe --readable --secret 123 --installdir "directory/to/install/the/app/in"
```


## getdiskspaceosx
The native library is already precompiled.

If you need to recompile it, simply open the project file (`getdiskspaceosx/getdiskspaceosx.xcodeproj`) in XCode and build it. The bundle will be automatically copied into `Assets/Plugins/PatchKit/x86_64`.

## Environment variables

* **PK_PATCHER_FORCE_SECRET** - force certain app secret
* **PK_PATCHER_FORCE_VERSION** - force certain app version
* **PK_PATCHER_API_URL** - change used url of API
* **PK_PATCHER_API_CACHE_URL** - changed used url of API cache
* **PK_PATCHER_KEYS_URL** - change used url of keys API
* **PK_PATCHER_KEEP_FILES_ON_ERROR** - keep temporary directories and files in case of patcher error

## Troubleshooting

### My patcher is opening in fullscreen mode

Head to `File/Build settings...` and click `Player Settings`. Now, open section titled `Resolution and Presentation` and make sure that `Fullscreen Mode` is set to **Windowed**. There you can also change the default resolution of the patcher, by modifying `Default Screen Width/Height`. You might also want to set `Resizable Window` to off.

### My patcher is not working when I minimize it

Head to `File/Build settings...` and click `Player Settings`. Now, open section titled `Resolution and Presentation` and make sure that `Run In Background` is turned on.

### My patcher is displaying *Resolution Dialog*

Head to `File/Build settings...` and click `Player Settings`. Now, open section titled `Resolution and Presentation` and make sure that `Display Resolution Dialog` is set to `Disabled`.
